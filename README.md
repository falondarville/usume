# USUME Full-Stack Application

Future functionality will include the ability to edit content populated onto the resume page, shareable public links to be sent to hiring managers, and more questions added for users to answer and get closer to being hired at their ideal job.

## Challenges and Learning Summary

This was the first time I had ever touched React.js. So I spend the first two days setting up the application for React and Express and building out the front end. I kept a log of all of the steps that it took to build this application, as it was the most robust that I had built to date. 

I created everything from the idea, design, database schema, server configuration, front-end functionality, validation, and more. The entire application was built over the course of eight full days. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
